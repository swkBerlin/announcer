  "description": "<p>We'll have a presentation on language constructs that are less known in mainstream programming. We'll cover features like pattern matching, higher-order functions, type classes, etc. It will be a mix of ideas from different programming paradigms including both OOP and functional programming.<\/p> <p>You are invited to join us and show off a feature you care about. The language and paradigm you prefer do not matter. Bring the laptop and show us something cool.<\/p> <p>If there is time left we can discuss pros and cons of specific features or even try to implement them.<\/p> <p>Although the examples will be (mostly) in Scala, the evening is not Scala-specific, but useful in different programing languages.<\/p> <p>And don't forget to plan some time to join us afterwards for drinks.<\/p>",
